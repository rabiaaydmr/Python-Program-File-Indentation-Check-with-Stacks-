# Python-Program-File-Indentation-Check-with-Stacks-
In this homework, you are asked to implement a program which analyzes whether a given .py file (python source code) contains indentation errors. Hence, you must check if each line can be bounded by an indentation level correctly. To achieve this, the program must use a stack data structure. The details of the methods, algorithms and the data structure to be used will be given in the subsequent sections of this homework specification.
